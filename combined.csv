231,231,Expectancies (beliefs about consequences of use),are,an important target for intervention
232,232,Evaluating evidence for expectancies and designing behavioral experiments,can be used to target,beliefs about consequences of use
233,233,A variety of CM procedures,have shown success in helping,patients reduce drug use
234,234,Cognitive behavioral therapist,needs to consider,how abstinence is to be rewarded as part of treatment
235,235,Traditional CM rewards,include,"monetary prizes, vouchers for goods, or treatment privileges"
236,236,Arrangement of social contingencies,should be considered,(in addition to traditional CM rewards)
237,237,Social contingencies,are evident in,BCT approaches
238,238,Contingencies,can be arranged to encourage,initial experiences of abstinence
239,239,Contingencies,can be arranged to encourage,entry into non-drug activities

241,241,Naturally-occurring rewards for abstinence,include,"greater employment, relationship, and social success"
242,242,Approaches to treatment of drug use patterns,have emphasized,exposure to the cues for drug use

245,245,Pilot studies (in illicit drug use and smoking cessation),have provided,early support for exposure to internal cues for drug use
246,246,Approaches in smoking cessation,have placed attention on,reduction of fears of anxiety sensations
247,247,Anxiety sensations,may amplify,aversiveness of withdrawal and affective consequences of nicotine cessation

256,256,Use of social support in treatment,may benefit,goals for abstinence and relationship functioning (for patients with strong support)
257,257,Ability to reject offers for substances,can be,a limitation and challenge to recovery
258,258,Rehearsal in session of socially-acceptable responses to offers for alcohol or drugs,provides patient with,a stronger skill set for applying refusals outside session
259,259,Rehearsal,can be supplemented by,imaginal exposure or emotional induction
260,260,Emotion regulation skills,can include,distress tolerance and coping skills
261,261,Use of problem-solving exercises and development of emotion regulation repertoire,enables patient to,determine and utilize non-drug use alternatives to distress
262,262,Strategies for coping with negative affect,include,"using social supports, engaging in pleasurable activities, and exercise"
263,263,Development of pleasurable sober activities,is of particular importance due to,time and energy spent on substance use activities
264,264,Sense of absence (when reducing substance use),can serve as,an impediment to abstinence
265,265,Concurrently increasing pleasant and goal-directed activities while reducing use,can be crucial for facilitating,initial and maintained abstinence
266,266,Goal-setting deficits,can be targeted,within the session as part of treatment
267,267,Guiding patients in setting treatment goals,can serve as,a first practice of skill building
268,268,Assisting patients in setting smaller goals,is,an important exercise (in service of longer term goals)
269,269,Inability to delay long-term pleasure for short-term pleasure,is,a characteristic feature of substance use disorders
270,270,Ability to set long-term goals,may be,compromised in SUDs
271,271,Skills building (for severe substance dependence patients),may require shifting,patient's relevant skills and goals from illicit to normative lifestyle
272,272,Skills adaptive while actively using,may translate poorly to,reconnecting with family and sober friends
273,273,Skills adaptive while actively using,may translate poorly to,obtaining and maintaining a job

281,281,Certain populations,may present,"particular challenges (e.g., pregnant women and incarcerated patients)"
282,282,Use of functional analysis and flexible utilization of treatment components,is important in,challenging circumstances
283,283,Shift in social and environmental contexts (use vs. non-use lifestyles),can be,a particular challenge
284,284,Individuals with long histories of substance misuse,often experience,"significant life consequences (e.g., unemployment, family difficulties, reduced social networks)"
285,285,Illicit drug use culture,is characterized by,"other illicit behaviors (e.g., drug dealing, theft, prostitution)"
286,286,Illicit drug use culture,values,"particular skills (e.g., ability to make a drug deal at 2:00AM)"
287,287,Illicit drug use culture,varies dramatically from,mainstream culture
288,288,Patient in treatment,is asked to transition to,a culture with few skills and resources
289,289,Patient in treatment,is asked to relinquish,parts of life with a sense of effectiveness and belonging from illicit lifestyle
290,290,Sense of belonging to substance use culture,can increase,ambivalence for change
291,291,It,is critical to establish,"alternatives for achieving a sense of belonging (e.g., social connection and effectiveness)"
292,292,Alternatives for achieving a sense of belonging,may include,"joining a social group, volunteer work, or other activity-based social opportunities"
293,293,Much work,remains to be done to improve,rates of treatment response
294,294,Several novel approaches,are being studied to enhance,behavioral treatments for substance use disorders
295,295,Use of computer-assisted delivery of treatment,is,a new approach
296,296,A study by Carroll and colleagues,compared,addition of biweekly computer-based CBT to standard drug counseling treatment
297,297,Patients who received computer-based treatment,had,significantly higher numbers of drug free urine tests and longer periods of abstinence
298,298,Benefits of computer-based treatment,continued through,a 6 month follow-up
299,299,Use of d-cycloserine (DCS),is,a novel approach to augment exposure based treatments
300,300,DCS,works as,a partial agonist targeting NMDA receptors
301,301,DCS,enhances,glutamate neurotransmission
